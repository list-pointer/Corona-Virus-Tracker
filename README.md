## About the Project
- Corona Virus Tracker is a Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. Powered Web Application.
- This Application Lists the current number of cases reported!
- It acts as a portal for the public to keep track of the latest cases of COVID-19.
- The Data is pulled from a GitHub source CSV file.Using the HTTP Request provided by java.
- CSV-commas library is used to filter the data and get the relevant data.
- Using this data other fields like total cases etc are calculated.
- This data is then fetched from the service to the frontend which uses thyme leaf to render the content on screen.
- The Application uses Spring Boot for handling the render request.
- The UI is kept minimum as the content is of more importance than the UI.
- This is a 100% open source project, all information and publishable data are available on Github as well.
- This project was inspired by the Coronavirus Outbreak Map by John Hopkins University that was very informative.
